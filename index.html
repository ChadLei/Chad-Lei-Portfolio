					<p>User stories give different parts of a website a meaning and a reason to be on there. Through these stories you can come to a sort of self-realization about whether a functionality is needed or not. I created them by putting myself in the shoes of a hiring manager who might be looking to hire someone, and imagined what kind of things they might look for in a ideal candidate.

					<p>A cognitive walkthrough is pretty much getting direct feedback from someone about your website by walking them through your website. It really gets a different perspective on your website, allowing you to see things that you might have been blind to before. The main challenge I had while conducting these were finding the right interviewees for them, since not everybody I asked had seen a site like mine before, so they were not always able to provide the feedback I was looking for.

					<p>For user testing, I conducted a question test and a click test. I felt that these 2 tests provided the most get-to-the-point results without confusing the interviewee. I was able to get valuable feedback on my website through these tests, including but limited to dislike/like to the design and usability of the site. One challenge however was definitely the different types of feedback I got, it was always focused on one thing specifically and I feel that I should have asked more different types of questions.

					<p>User interviews allowed me to get to know my users, and I was able to develop the beginning rough draft of my website based off of these interviews. I asked questions about a interviewee's educational and academic background, as well as future goals and how they might display these things on a website.

					<p>A competitor analysis makes me more concious of people around me and out there in the world who are doing similar things as I am, and keeps me on the toes by understanding what I'm doing right or wrong compared to others. I reviewed a web developer I found online, a online service called Fiverr where you can pay someone to do practically anything for a price, and a website creating company that allows you to create your own website at ease.

					<p>A feature value matrix is, in short, a chart that allows you to categorize and rate the features of your website based off of categories such as user value, business value, and development effort. I selected these features from the interviews that I conducted, as well as seeing that these were the essential functionalities to have on a portfolio website. I reviewed them because they all were popular sources when looking for creating websites, and I wanted to be aware of some things they offered that I might make me as popular as they are when it comes to providing those type of services.

					<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AZSOflILvmOrtxBoFV29AepST0pgtSkjRN5VAnhaYqM/edit?usp=sharing">View Here</a></p>
					<p>I prioritized the features by putting myself into the perspective of a potential user and developer. I thought about what things someone else might find interesting and what things might be actually too hard to develop, and by doing this I was able to make the first steps into bringing my website to life.

					<h4>Summary of Findings</h4>
					<p>
					Through user research and user testing, I found that my first draft thoughts on how I wanted to approach building my website were very surface level. This could be due to my lack of experience in creating websites in general, but I also noticed that it's just things you need to get from others because one can not see everything that is needed.
					However, most of the research resulted in simplying confirming that the vision I had for my website was correct, and it strengthened my belief in the content and features I put in there.
					</p>
					<p>
					It was like everytime I thought I had finally finished my website, these user tests would give me something that I didn't even think about, and it's right back to working at it. It came in like a cycle, and I think the biggest challenge was keeping myself motivated throughout this process while knowing that my website would not be truly complete, at least for a while. Results helped me understand how my website could be improved by either giving me direct things to change or making me see my own website from a different perspective and then seeing which things I thought I might be lacking.

					<h4>Incorporation of Findings</h4>
					<p>
					When I first began building my portfolio, it was originally a multi-paged website, but user research was one of the first things that made me realize that having it as a one page website would be the best choice. Not only did users that I interviewed find it easier to use a one page website, I also noticed through my feature value matrix that developing it would be easier on me as well, due to my current experience and knowledge.
					</p>
					<p>
					Some challenges I faced include my research results conflicting with what I personally wanted and me not having enough time and skill to develop some features that users would have found useful and cool. For example, some thought that my design choices may have been too distracting from the main point of my portfolio, but I wanted my website to convey a sort of lighter mood and to show some of my personality. Another thing was that I wanted certain buttons and links to sort of pop up when a user hovered their cursor over them and for images to fade in slowly when a user scrolls to that part of the website, but this will take me more time to learn since it seems to require higher level Jquery and such.
					</p>
					<p>
					Originally, the navigation on my site would just directly jump to a certain part of my page, but through research I found that that was one thing that needed to be fixed, so I implemented a smooth scrolling transition using Jquery. For my design, a lot of my feedback was about my typography as well as use of colors. In the future, I plan to change the font types of my headers and paragraphs, in order to lessen confusion about what is what. I also plan to change my current color design to a more serious color scheme, once I get more content in there (projects, experience, etc.). In the mean time, I'll keep looking at other portfolios that inspire me and see how I can further improve.
